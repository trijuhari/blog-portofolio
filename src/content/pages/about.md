Iâ€™m Tri Juhari, a Data Enthusiast, technical writer, and Student. This website is a compendium of the things I have learned over the years.

I aim to create a beautiful corner of the web free of ads, sponsored posts, newsletter pop-ups, affiliate links, and the rest of the annoying noise we're so accustomed to seeing on the internet these days.
